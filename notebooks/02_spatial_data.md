# Chapter 2: Spatial Data

## Introduction to geographic thinking

explain the ideas behind common geographical processes

## Representations

explain object vs. field models of geographical processes more explicitly


## Data Structure

all maps are wrong, but some are useful

data cubes

postgis vector table

## Connecting the conceptual to the computational

### Conventional matching of raster -> field and vector -> object

"desktop view"

### This categorization is now breaking up (data is data)

examples of
- mapping between
- changes in "typical" representations of
  - population
  - ???

## Ideas
- all models are wrong, some are useful
- all maps are wrong, some are useful
- theory versus measurement
- letting the data speak for itself (ml? esda?)
- data mining from bad to good to ??
- process vs pattern
- matched filter (rodgerson)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_filterâ€©
    - scale invariance (tobler)
- target-> data scientisits
- information content
    - effective sample size
    - different narrative from that for GIScientists
- target-> GIScientists
- spatial data is data with locational information encoded within
- how that is done 
- conceptual linking of representation/encoding to process
- there is a division between conceptualization and data models
- raster versus vector, field versus object, hybrid
- technical has driven things more so than conceptualization
- population versus sample (stochastic process)
    - Summerfield, M., 1983. "Populations, Samples and Statistical Inference in Geography." The Professional Geographer, 35, 143-149.
- integral (goodchild), spatial probability versus probability distribution
- how does this relate to a surface
- conceptual/represetnational model versus data model
- scale 
- are there issues we want to be opinionated about versus those we want to present different views on
